Tutorials
=========

We provide several tutorials to help you get started with `pycvxset`. The tutorials are designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook, which allows you to interact with the code and experiment with the library. The tutorials are available in the `docs/examples/` directory of `pycvxset`.

For your convenience, we provide a link to the tutorials below:

1. :doc:`Polytope <polytope>`
2. :doc:`ConstrainedZonotope <constrained_zonotope>`
3. :doc:`Application: Reachability using Polytope/ConstrainedZonotope classes <application_reachability>`
4. :doc:`Code snippets used in ACC 2025 tool paper <acc2025_code_snippets>`

In the above tutorials, we demonstrate how to use `pycvxset` to perform various operations on polytopes, ellipsoids, and constrained zonotopes. We also provide an application example that demonstrates the use of `pycvxset` in reachability analysis. The tutorials are designed to be self-contained, and we encourage you to run them in a Jupyter notebook to understand the code and experiment with the library.
