    Plot a 2D or 3D polytope.

    Args:
        ax (axis object, optional): Axis on which the patch is to be plotted
        patch_args (dict, optional): Arguments to pass for plotting faces and edges. See [Matplotlib-patch]_ for options
            for patch_args for 2D and [Matplotlib-Line3DCollection]_ for options for patch_args for 3D. Defaults to
            None, in which case we set edgecolor to black, and facecolor to skyblue.
        vertex_args (dict, optional): Arguments to pass for plotting vertices. See [Matplotlib-scatter]_ for
            options for vertex_args for 2D and [Matplotlib-Axes3D.scatter]_ for options for vertex_args for 3D. Defaults
            to None, in which case we skip plotting the vertices.
        autoscale_enable (bool, optional): When set to True, matplotlib adjusts axes to view full polytope. Defaults
            to True.
        decimal_precision (int, optional): When plotting a 3D polytope that is in V-Rep and not in H-Rep, we round
            vertex to the specified precision to avoid numerical issues. Defaults to PLOTTING_DECIMAL_PRECISION_CDD
            specified in pycvxset.common.constants.

    Raises:
        ValueError: When an incorrect axes is provided.
        NotImplementedError: When a polytope.dim >= 4 or == 1 | autoscale_enable is set to False for 3D plotting.
        UserWarning: When an empty polytope is provided.
        UserWarning: In 3D plotting, when all faces have less than 3 vertices

    Returns:
        (axes, handle, handle): Tuple with axes containing the polygon, handle for plotting patch, handle for plotting
        vertices

    Notes:
        - plot is a wrapper for :meth:`plot2d` and :meth:`plot3d` functions. See
          their documentation for more details.
        - *Vertex-halfspace enumeration for 2D polytopes*: If a 2D polytope is in H-Rep, vertex enumeration is performed
          to plot the polytope in 2D. No vertex enumeration is performed for a 2D polytope in V-Rep. This function calls
          minimize_V_rep to simplify plotting.
        - *Vertex-halfspace enumeration for 3D polytopes*: The 3D polytope needs to have both V-Rep and H-Rep.
          Consequently, at least a halfspace/vertex enumeration is performed for a 3D polytope in single representation.
        - *Rounding vertices*: This function calls :meth:`pycvxset.common.prune_and_round_vertices` when a 3D polytope
          in V-Rep is given to be plotted.
        - *Handle returned for the patches*: For 2D plot, axis handle of the single patch is returned. For 3D
          plotting, multiple patches are present, and plot returns the first patch's axis handle. In this case, the
          order of patches are determined by the use of `pycddlib.Polyhedron.get_input_incidence
          <https://pycddlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/polyhedron.html#cdd.Polyhedron.get_input_incidence>`_ from the
          specified (A, b). Also, labeling the first patch is done using Poly3DCollection.
        - *Disabling face colors*: We can plot the polytope frames without filling it by setting
          `patch_args['facecolor'] = None` or `patch_args['fill'] = False`. If visual comparison of 3D polytopes is
          desired, it may be better to plot just the polytope frames instead by setting patch_args['facecolor'] = None.

    Warning:
        This function may produce erroneous-looking plots when visually comparing multiple 3D sets. For more info on
        matplotlib limitations, see
        https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/toolkits/mplot3d/faq.html#my-3d-plot-doesn-t-look-right-at-certain-viewing-angles.
        If visual comparison is desired, it may be better to plot just the polytope frame instead by setting
        patch_args['facecolor'] = None.
