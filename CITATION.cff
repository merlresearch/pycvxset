  pycvxset is a Python package for manipulation and
  visualization of convex sets. Currently, pycvxset supports
  the following three representations --- polytopes,
  ellipsoids, and constrained zonotopes (which are
  equivalent to polytopes). pycvxset supports constructing
  convex and compact sets from a variety of representations,
  transform between these representations, and perform
  various operations on these sets.
